# Rusty Advent Of Code 2020

2020 is a particularly bad year, we all know that, and to add my share of bad
news I wanted to publish my source code.

To run, use rustup to get rust and cargo. Then `cargo run --example` to run the
code for one specific day, e.g. to run day 1 code:

    $ cargo run --example r01

I'm pretty sure 2020 will get in the way and prevent me from finishing this
challenge, even if this year I'm motivated to complete it.
